# Deploy Force Trigger

Last updated: 2025-07-09 14:42 JST

## Changes Made
- Disabled OTP authentication functionality
- Reverted to standard registration flow
- Fixed Vercel deployment configuration
- Updated vercel.json build command for proper dist directory handling
- Removed OTP verification components from login flow
- Updated registration description text

## Deployment Status
- Build: Fixed
- Configuration: Updated (v2)
- Ready for deployment: ✅

## Build Command Fixed (v2)
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd simple-preview && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "simple-preview/dist"
}
```

**Key Fix**: Set outputDirectory to `simple-preview/dist` directly instead of copying files. This resolves the "dist directory not found" error by pointing Vercel to the correct build output location.

## Previous Issues Resolved
1. ❌ `cp -r dist ../` command failed - dist not found
2. ✅ Direct path to `simple-preview/dist` - no copy needed
3. ✅ Simplified build process - more reliable
